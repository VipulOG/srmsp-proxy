# srmsp-proxy

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the SRM University student experience by serving as an enhancement proxy for the student portal. It simplifies attendance management through a personalized calendar and provides additional insights into the academic schedule.

## But why?
I can't read minds, but I'm guessing you're wondering, "Did anyone even need this?" Frankly, who knows? I built this for my sanity, and if it helps a fellow student, why not? We've all got our unique struggles, and maybe this is the solution someone's been silently wishing for.
